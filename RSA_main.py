""" Wnat the user to be able to click enter to step through and see how the math works for doing an RSA encryption 
    First i need to employ a simple RSA encryption to get full credit for the final project"""

# Step 1 RSA Key Generation
# the "sender" selects two prime numbers p and q and an exponent e
# p, q, and e are the private key for the sender
