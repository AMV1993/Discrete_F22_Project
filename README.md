# Discrete_F22_Project
Discrete Mathematics final project - Fall 2022 - CU Boulder

# Brief Project Overview
- Applying RSA encpription methods to an encryption algorythim using python.

# Project Goal and outcomes/results
  # Goals
  - Write a program that allows the user to step through and see the process of creating the key values and how to decrypt and encrypted message.
  
  
  # Outcomes/results
  
# NOTES:
- There are libraries that already exist in python to use RSA type encryption. 
- This program is a "brute force method" of trying to encrypt / decrypt using RSA methods. 

# major hang up's / issues
- converting a string into a number that does not lose the information of what each character in the string represents.
